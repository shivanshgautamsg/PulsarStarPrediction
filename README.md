# Pulsar Star Prediction Model

## Introduction

This documentation presents a project focused on using machine learning to classify pulsar stars based on radio emission patterns. Pulsar stars, a rare type of neutron stars, emit detectable radio emissions as they rotate. Identifying these pulsar candidates amidst noise and interference is crucial for astronomical research. Machine learning algorithms, particularly classification models, are employed to automatically label pulsar candidates and facilitate rapid analysis.

## About

**Pulsar Stars:** Pulsar stars are neutron stars that emit detectable radio emissions as they rotate. These emissions produce periodic patterns that can be observed on Earth. Identifying pulsar stars among other signals, noise, and interference is challenging but essential for understanding space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter.

## Data Preprocessing

Upon loading the dataset, missing values are checked and handled appropriately. The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Feature variables are extracted for both sets, and the target variable representing the class labels (0 for negative class, 1 for positive class) is separated.

## Model Training and Evaluation

An XGBoost Classifier model is trained on the training data. XGBoost is chosen for its ability to handle imbalanced datasets and accurately classify minority positive classes. The trained model is evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report to assess its performance in detecting pulsar stars.

## Machine Learning Model Overview

- **XGBoost Classifier:** A gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in handling complex datasets. XGBoost is particularly effective for binary classification tasks and is widely adopted in various domains, including astronomy.

## Model Evaluation

The trained XGBoost Classifier model is evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify pulsar stars and its performance across different classes.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for classifying pulsar stars based on radio emission patterns. By leveraging the XGBoost Classifier model, accurate classification of pulsar candidates is achieved, enabling astronomers to efficiently identify pulsar stars amidst noise and interference. The developed model has the potential to enhance astronomical research by facilitating the rapid analysis of pulsar candidates and contributing to our understanding of the universe's fascinating phenomena.
